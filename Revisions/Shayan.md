Title: “hidden layers” “of” blockchains

- Not correct

- No definitions
  - Front-running, cryptojacking, oracles -> developers/users shortfall in knowledge of (expectation gap, mental models, red-tape, fine print)
  - Discrepancy between "how blockchains work" and "how tradition systems work", where assumption is that blockchains are the same traditional systems
  - Nuances, discrepancies

  * Understanding Technical {Nuances} of Blockchains // and their {Unforeseen} Consequences
  * What I study // and why
    * Make sure there is a crisp definition of each thing in {}
    * Nuances:
  
- | Chapter        | Blockchain System                                        | Non-Blockchain System                                        |
  | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Crypto-jacking | Trick users into mining without them realizing           | Nodes are deliberately deployed                              |
  | Front-running  | Everyone can see your transaction before it is finalized | A sent transaction is only seen by the server that processes it |
  | Oracles        | Smart contracts can only reference on-chain events       | Servers can access anything online                           |
  | Auditing       | Not so different from traditional system                 | Financial audit procedures are well-developed                |
  |                |                                                          |                                                              |

- Cryptojacking
  - Accessibility libraries
- Front-running
  - Mitigation is novel techniques, existing techniques?
    - Positive or normative
