Each chapter in this thesis discusses their own future work and related \textit{follow-up work}, as well as, address the research questions defined in~\ref{sec:research_questions}. As detailed in each chapter and through the research questions, numerous open questions and challenges remain. These challenges span technical, educational, psychological~\cite{gaggioli2019middleman}, legal, and ethical dimensions, necessitating a multifaceted approach to future research.

Below, we summarize the key points discussed for each research question:


\textbf{Research Theme: How do the inherent characteristics of blockchain technology, such as transparency, pseudonymity, and immutability, create unique (ethical) challenges?}

The inherent characteristics of blockchain technology present distinct ethical challenges that are explored throughout this dissertation. Transparency, while enhancing trust and allowing for the verification of transactions, also poses significant privacy risks as transaction histories are publicly accessible, potentially exposing user activities and sensitive information. Additionally, the transparency in the network, creates front-running opportunities to extract value from unconfirmed transactions. Pseudonymity, which protects user identity, complicates accountability, making it difficult to trace illicit activities back to their perpetrators. Immutability, a cornerstone of blockchain's security, prevents the alteration or correction of transactions, even when they are fraudulent or flawed.

These aspects create a complex landscape for regulators and users, who must navigate the fine balance between leveraging blockchain's benefits and mitigating its risks. Regulators face the challenge of developing frameworks that protect user privacy without compromising the transparency that underpins blockchain's trust model. Users, on the other hand, need to understand how to engage with these technologies responsibly, ensuring that their actions do not inadvertently contribute to misuse or ethical breaches.

Throughout the thesis, these trade-offs and complexities are examined in various contexts, illustrating the multifaceted nature of blockchain ethics. This discussion provides a foundation for understanding how to approach blockchain technology in a safe and ethical manner, highlighting the need for ongoing dialogue and adaptive regulatory measures.


\textbf{RQ1: How feasible and profitable would use of browser-based cryptojacking as an alternative to traditional online advertisements be? Is it easily detectable by the user?}

This question is comprehensively examined in Chapter~\ref{sec:cryptojacking}. Browser-based cryptojacking emerged as a novel method for generating revenue, potentially reducing privacy invasions associated with traditional online advertisements. The existing ecosystem is fragmented and often compromises user safety through practices like malvertising~\cite{li2012knowing}. Chapter~\ref{sec:cryptojacking} discussed some initial challenges and potential solutions of using blockchain technology to change this industry, but many questions remain unanswered. However, it raises significant ethical concerns, primarily due to its tendency to operate without user consent, leading to the unauthorized exploitation of computational resources. The ethicality of cryptojacking is heavily dependent on transparency and obtaining explicit user consent, highlighting the urgent need for regulatory frameworks to address these issues.

Practically, cryptojacking has notable implications for user experience, device performance, and energy consumption. Unauthorized cryptojacking can degrade the performance of user devices, increase energy consumption, and potentially cause hardware damage. These practical concerns underscore the need for effective mitigation strategies. Existing solutions, such as browser extensions and ad-blocking software, offer some protection against cryptojacking but are not foolproof and do not address the root causes of the problem.

Future research in this area should prioritize the development of more robust mechanisms for detecting and preventing cryptojacking. Many follow up research brought forth novel approaches to detect cryptojacking as discussed in~\ref{sec:cryptojackingfollowup}. These include advancements in browser security features and more sophisticated detection algorithms. Additionally, exploring alternative revenue models that respect user privacy and autonomy is essential. Potential alternatives could involve more transparent and consensual forms of monetization, ensuring that users are fully aware and agreeable to the use of their computational resources. This comprehensive approach can help balance the benefits of innovative revenue models with the necessity of ethical practices and user protection.



\textbf{RQ2: There has been suggestions that front-running attacks exploit the decentralized nature of blockchains. How prevalent are these attacks?}

This question is thoroughly investigated in Chapter~\ref{sec:frontrunning}. Front-running attacks take advantage of the transparency and decentralized structure of blockchain applications. In our research we found out that almost all applications on blockchain can be vulnerable to front-running attacks and these types of attacks should be considered when designing any smart contract system. In decentralized blockchains, all transactions are visible to everyone before they are confirmed. This visibility allows (malicious) actors to observe pending transactions and insert their own transactions in a way that enables them to profit, often at the expense of others. 

The strategies to mitigate front-running attacks are diverse and multifaceted. One approach involves implementing privacy-enhancing technologies that obscure transaction details until they are confirmed, thus reducing the opportunity for front-runners to exploit transaction visibility. Another strategy is adjusting transaction ordering protocols to randomize or prioritize transactions in a manner that reduces the ability to predict and exploit the order of execution. Additionally, some propose democratizing the profit from front-running by redistributing gains among all participants, though this approach raises its own ethical and security concerns.

However, these mitigation strategies are not without challenges. Privacy-enhancing technologies can introduce new security vulnerabilities and might lead to increased complexity in the blockchain protocol. Adjusting transaction ordering protocols could potentially lead to censorship, where certain transactions are unfairly prioritized or delayed. The idea of democratizing profit redistribution can be contentious, as it might incentivize new forms of manipulation and raise questions about the fair distribution of rewards. The rapid pace of technological advancement in blockchain often outstrips the ability of regulators to respond effectively, as seen historically with front-running in traditional financial markets. Future research should focus on developing fair and resilient systems to manage front-running and ensuring regulatory frameworks can adapt to the nuances of blockchain technology.

Our research was followed up by many great research in this area, as discussed in~\ref{sec:frontrunning:followup}. Many have focused on developing new strategies to mitigate front-running attacks, such as using zero-knowledge proofs to conceal transaction details or design practices preventing transaction order dependencies in the applications. It is worth noting that many of these researches are focused on democratizing MEV profits, redistributing them among all participants in the blockchain network. A thorough ethical analysis is required to balance the technical benefits of these strategies with their potential social and economic impacts. By addressing these concerns, the blockchain community can work towards creating a more secure and equitable ecosystem.


\textbf{RQ3: What are the key components of an oracle? How do these components come together, and what are the potential vulnerabilities?}

In Chapter~\ref{sec:oracles}, we dissect the key components of oracles, --modular workflow--, and examine how these components interact to provide reliable data to the blockchain. Oracles function as intermediaries that provide smart contracts with access to external data, allowing blockchain applications to interact with real-world events and information. This capability is crucial for a wide range of decentralized applications (DApps), from financial services to supply chain management, where real-time, accurate data is essential for decision-making and contract execution. 

However, the reliance on oracles introduces a critical point of vulnerability. Oracles often depend on centralized data sources, which can be compromised, manipulated, or provide inaccurate information, posing substantial risks to the integrity of the blockchain applications. For instance, if an oracle is hacked or feeds false data, it can lead to incorrect contract execution, financial losses, and broader systemic risks within the blockchain network. Many of oracle vulnerabilities might look unique to the oracles, however, exploring the oracles using the modular framework it becomes clear that many of these vulnerabilities are not unique to oracles and are common in any decentralized system.

To address these vulnerabilities, several strategies are discussed in detail in Chapter~\ref{sec:oracles}. One approach is to decentralize data sources, thereby reducing the risk associated with any single point of failure. By aggregating data from multiple sources and employing consensus mechanisms among them, the accuracy and reliability of the data provided to the blockchain can be significantly enhanced. Another critical strategy involves implementing robust verification mechanisms. These can include cross-referencing data from different oracles, using trusted hardware to secure data feeds, and employing redundancy to ensure that data discrepancies can be detected and addressed promptly. Cryptographic proofs also play a vital role in ensuring the integrity and authenticity of data provided by oracles. Techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs can be used to verify the correctness of data without revealing the data itself, enhancing privacy and security. Additionally, secure multi-party computation (MPC) can enable multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private, further bolstering the trustworthiness of oracle-provided data.

Future research should focus on advancing these strategies and exploring new methodologies to enhance oracle security or remove the need of an oracle in the decentralized application. This includes developing standardized protocols for oracle implementation, enhancing the robustness of consensus algorithms used by decentralized oracles, and integrating advanced cryptographic techniques to safeguard data integrity. By addressing these challenges, the blockchain community can strengthen the reliability of oracles, thereby ensuring the secure and accurate execution of smart contracts and other blockchain applications.



\textbf{RQ4: What are the foundational issues and challenges auditing firms face in verifying cryptoassets? Can we cluster these challenges into categories and propose solutions to address them?}

Auditing cryptoassets presents significant challenges due to the need for technical expertise and the limitations of traditional auditing practices, which are not designed to accommodate the complexities of blockchain technology. Chapter~\ref{sec:auditing} explores these issues in depth, highlighting the specific difficulties auditing firms face when verifying the \textit{existence, ownership, and valuation} of cryptoassets, as well as, the \textit{internal control} required to safe keep these cryptoassets.

One major challenge is the lack of standardized accounting practices for cryptoassets. Current accounting standards were developed long before the advent of blockchain technology and thus are not equipped to handle its unique features. This gap creates uncertainty and inconsistency in how cryptoassets are recorded, valued, and reported. Additionally, the volatility and complexity of cryptoasset markets, aside from the underlying technology, further complicate the auditing process. Cryptoassets can experience rapid price fluctuations, which makes their valuation challenging and necessitates frequent updates to financial statements. Another significant challenge is the technical expertise required to understand blockchain technology and its implications for financial reporting. Auditors must be able to navigate the intricacies of blockchain transactions, including the verification of digital signatures, the assessment of smart contract functionalities, and in some cases understand the consensus mechanisms. This requires specialized training and a deep understanding of both blockchain technology and financial auditing principles.

To address these challenges, several solutions are proposed in Chapter~\ref{sec:auditing}. Developing specialized audit procedures tailored to the unique aspects of cryptoassets is essential. This includes creating new guidelines for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of cryptoassets in financial statements. Enhancing technical capabilities within auditing firms is also crucial. This can be achieved through targeted training programs and the incorporation of blockchain analysis tools that can assist auditors in verifying transactions and assessing risks. Establishing industry standards for auditing cryptoassets is another critical step. These standards would provide a consistent framework for auditors to follow, reducing ambiguity and increasing the reliability of financial reports. Additionally, the adoption of modern and more reliable approaches to financial statements, such as Real-time Financial Reporting (RFR), can be enabled by blockchain technology. RFR allows for the continuous updating and verification of financial information, providing greater transparency and timeliness.

However, the current accounting standards must evolve to accommodate these new approaches. It remains unclear how to apply traditional accounting principles to blockchain technology, and there are numerous examples of these complexities discussed in the chapter. Furthermore, while the chapter focuses on centralized companies holding cryptoassets, the rise of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) presents new auditing challenges. DAOs operate without a central authority, making it difficult to determine how to audit these entities and what it means to conduct an audit in this context.

Additionally, the rise of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) presents new auditing challenges, as these entities lack centralized control. Future work should aim to establish new auditing standards and methodologies tailored to the decentralized nature of DAOs and other blockchain-based entities~\cite{tan2023open}.

I hope this thesis serves as a starting point for further research in these areas. Blockchain technology holds immense potential to benefit society, but realizing these benefits requires continued exploration of ethical and fair system design. By addressing these challenges, we can mitigate malicious unforeseen consequences and harness blockchain's full potential.
