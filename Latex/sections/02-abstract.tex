% Hello. No more than 250 words.

In this dissertation, we delve into the blockchain technology, its applications, and the unforeseen consequences of the technical nuances. Cryptojacking, as a promise disrupt the online advertisement businesses, due to the policy void and technical complexity fell victim of its own success. The transparency and permissionless nature of blockchain technology, enables every participant in the network to act as an actor with privileged information and partake in front-running attack on other users for profit. Oracles, as the source of truth in blockchains, are critical points of failure in many decentralized applications (DApps) and require more in depth understanding of implementation details to work as promised. Cryptoassets, as becoming a big sector in the financial world, are too novel for most auditors to properly assess and verify in the financial statements. In this dissertation, we aim to discuss the technical nuances that result in misunderstanding in what is promised by blockchains and what their implications are. Overall, we believe by closing the gap between the traditional finance and the technical advancement of blockchain technology, both auditors and companies holding cryptoassets, can benefit from the transparency and real-time financial reporting this technology enables.
