Title: 	\tab \textbf{The Hidden Layers of Blockchains: Technical Nuances and their Unforeseen Consequences}

In this dissertation, we explore the complexities of blockchain technology, its diverse applications, and the unforeseen consequences that have emerged. Cryptojacking, initially seen as a potential disruptor to the online advertising industry, ultimately succumbed to its own success due to regulatory gaps and technical intricacies. The inherent transparency and permissionless nature of blockchain allow every participant to potentially exploit privileged information, leading to front-running attacks for personal gain. Additionally, oracles, vital for providing real-world data to blockchains, might lead to critical vulnerabilities within decentralized applications (DApps) and necessitate a deeper understanding of their operational mechanisms. With the rise of cryptoassets as a significant financial sector, auditors face challenges in accurately evaluating and reporting these assets due to their novelty. This dissertation aims to bridge the gap between the ambitious promises of blockchain technology and its real-world implications, highlighting the technical nuances that often lead to misunderstandings. We argue that by narrowing the divide between traditional finance and blockchain's technological advancements, both auditors and companies holding cryptoassets stand to gain from the enhanced transparency and the potential for real-time financial reporting offered by this technology.
