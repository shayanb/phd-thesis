	abstract = {In general, most elections follow the principle of equality, or as it came to be known, the principle of ``one person -- one vote''. However, this principle might pose difficulties for voters, who are not well informed regarding the particular matter that is voted on. In order to address this issue, a new form of voting has been proposed, namely proxy voting. In proxy voting, each voter has the possibility to delegate her voting right to another voter, so called proxy, that she considers a trusted expert on the matter. In this paper we propose an end-to-end verifiable Internet voting scheme, which to the best of our knowledge is the first scheme to address voter coercion in the proxy voting setting.},

@inproceedings{YaCl17,
	abstract = {Throughout the years, many cryptographically verifiable voting systems have been proposed with a whole spectrum of features and security assumptions. Where the voter casts an in-person (and possibly paper) ballot and leaves, as is common in a governmental election, the majority of the proposals fall in the category of providing unconditional integrity and computational privacy. A minority of papers have looked at the inverse scenario: everlasting privacy with computational integrity. However as far as we know, no paper has succeeded in providing both unconditional integrity and privacy in this setting---it has only been explored in boardroom voting schemes where voters participate in the tallying process. Our paper aims for a two-level contribution: first, we present a concrete system with these security properties (one that works as a backend for common ballot styles like Scantegrity II or Pr{\^e}t {\`a} Voter); and second, we provide some insight into how different combinations of security assumptions are interdependent.},

@techreport{BIS96,
	abstract = {Digital currencies, and especially those which have an embedded decentralised transfer mechanism based on the use of a distributed ledger, are an innovation that could have a range of impacts on various aspects of financial markets and the wider economy. These could include potential disruption to business models and systems, as well as facilitating new economic interactions and linkages. Currently, such schemes are not widely used or accepted, and they face a series of challenges that could limit their future growth. However, some digital currency schemes have demonstrated that their underlying technology could feasibly be used for peer-to-peer transactions in the absence of a trusted third party. Such technology may have potential to improve some aspects of the efficiency of payment services and financial market infrastructures (FMIs) in general. In particular, these improvements might arise in circumstances where intermediation through a central party is not currently cost-effective. This report considers the possible implications of interest to central banks arising from these innovations.},

	abstract = {FastPay allows a set of distributed authorities, some of which are Byzantine, to maintain a high-integrity and availability settlement system for pre-funded payments. It can be used to settle payments in a native unit of value (crypto-currency), or as a financial side-infrastructure to support retail payments in fiat currencies. FastPay is based on Byzantine Consistent Broadcast as its core primitive, foregoing the expenses of full atomic commit channels (consensus). The resulting system has lowlatency for both confirmation and payment finality. Remarkably, each authority can be sharded across many machines to allow unbounded horizontal scalability. Our experiments demonstrate intra-continental confirmation latency of less than 100ms, making FastPay applicable to point of sale payments. In laboratory environments, we achieve over 80,000 transactions per second with 20 authorities\textemdash surpassing the requirements of current retail card payment networks, while significantly increasing their robustness.},

@article{StCl99,
	abstract = {Abstract: Electronic cash in Canada is moving from the developmental into the implementation phase. Mondex, a smart card-based electronic money system, began its most extensive field trial worldwide on February 13, 1997 in Guelph, Ontario, foreshadowing a Canadian nationwide roll-out. This paper introduces the basic concepts of electronic money and describes the Mondex system and the dynamics of its current test in detail. This provides the basis for an analysis of its social and political implications. Mondex raises interrelated questions of access, privacy, and the development of private currencies. We conclude that Mondex has a strong potential, but if the implementation is completely market driven there is a substantial danger of excluding whole segments of the population from a technology which is positioned to become a key element of the future technological infrastructure. The flexibility of the Mondex system creates a new, potentially significant threat to the individual's privacy. Electronic cash, by effectively introducing private currencies, contributes to the decrease of economic influence of the nation state's institutions vis-{\`a}-vis global financial institutions. The paper concludes by proposing starting points for the policy debate to develop an inclusive and privacy-safeguarding framework for implementing electronic cash in Canada. R{\'e}sum{\'e}: L'argent {\'e}lectronique au Canada est en train de passer d'une phase de d{\'e}veloppement {\`a} une phase de mise en place. Mondex, un syst{\`e}me d'argent {\'e}lectronique qui se fonde sur les cartes \"intelligentes\", a commenc{\'e} les essais sur le terrain les plus vastes au monde le 13 f{\'e}vrier 1997 {\`a} Guelph en Ontario, pr{\'e}sageant un {\'e}largissement de services {\`a} l'{\'e}chelle du pays. Cet article introduit les concepts de base de l'argent {\'e}lectronique et d{\'e}crit en d{\'e}tail le syst{\`e}me Mondex et la dynamique des essais actuels. Cette description sert de fondement {\`a} une analyse des implications sociales et politiques du syst{\`e}me. Mondex soul{\`e}ve des questions interreli{\'e}es d'acc{\`e}s, de respect pour la vie priv{\'e}e et de d{\'e}veloppement de devises priv{\'e}es. Nous concluons que Mondex a beaucoup de potentiel, mais, si la mise en place d{\'e}pend compl{\`e}tement du march{\'e}, il y a un danger significatif d'exclure des segments complets de la population d'une technologie qui pourrait devenir un {\'e}l{\'e}ment cl{\'e} de l'infrastructure technologique future.

	abstract = {The mifare Classic is a contactless smart card that is used extensively in access control for office buildings, payment systems for public transport, and other applications. We reverse engineered the security mechanisms of this chip: the authentication protocol, the symmetric cipher, and the initialization mechanism. We describe several security vulnerabilities in these mechanisms and exploit these vulnerabilities with two attacks; both are capable of retrieving the secret key from a genuine reader. The most serious one recovers the secret key from just one or two authentication attempts with a genuine reader in less than a second on ordinary hardware and without any pre-computation. Using the same methods, an attacker can also eavesdrop the communication between a tag and a reader, and decrypt the whole trace, even if it involves multiple authentications. This enables an attacker to clone a card or to restore a real card to a previous state.},

@techreport{Bje17,
	abstract = {The prospect of central banks issuing digital currency (CBDC) immediately raises the question of how this new form of money should co-exist and interact with existing forms of money. This paper evaluates three different scenarios for the implementation of CBDC in terms of their monetary policy implications. In the `money user scenario' CBDC co-exists with both cash and commercial bank deposits. In the `money manager scenario' cash is abolished and CBDC co-exists only with commercial bank deposits. And in the `money maker scenario' commercial bank deposits are abolished and CBDC co-exist only with cash. The evaluation is based on an adaption of the classical international monetary policy trilemma to a domestic monetary system with multiple forms of money. Our proposition is that a monetary system with two competing money creators, the central bank and the commercial banking sector, can simultaneously only pursue two out of the following three policy objectives: Free convertibility between CBDC and bank money, parity between CBDC and bank money, and central bank monetary sovereignty, which is the use of monetary policy for anything else than support for commercial bank credit creation. This means that the decision on the design of a monetary system with CBDC implies a crucial political decision on the priorities of the central bank.},

@techreport{BIS15,
	abstract = {Digital currencies, and especially those which have an embedded decentralised transfer mechanism based on the use of a distributed ledger, are an innovation that could have a range of impacts on various aspects of financial markets and the wider economy. These could include potential disruption to business models and systems, as well as facilitating new economic interactions and linkages. Currently, such schemes are not widely used or accepted, and they face a series of challenges that could limit their future growth. However, some digital currency schemes have demonstrated that their underlying technology could feasibly be used for peer-to-peer transactions in the absence of a trusted third party. Such technology may have potential to improve some aspects of the efficiency of payment services and financial market infrastructures (FMIs) in general. In particular, these improvements might arise in circumstances where intermediation through a central party is not currently cost-effective. This report considers the possible implications of interest to central banks arising from these innovations.},

Our results suggest that reparameterization of block size and intervals should be viewed only as a first increment toward achieving next-generation, high-load blockchain protocols, and major advances will additionally require a basic rethinking of technical approaches. We offer a structured perspective on the design space for such approaches. Within this perspective, we enumerate and briefly discuss a number of recently proposed protocol ideas and offer several new ideas and open challenges.},

	abstract = {Digitalization is reshaping economic activity, shrinking the role of cash, and spurring new digital forms of money. Central banks have been pondering wheter and how to adapt. One possibility is central bank digital currency (CBDC)-- a widely accessible digital form of fiat money that could be legal tender. This discussion note proposes a conceptual framework to assess the case for CBDC adoption from the perspective of users and central banks. It discusses possible CBDC designs, and explores potential benefits and costs, with a focus on the impact on monetary policy, financial stability, and integrity. This note also surveys research and pilot studies on CBDC by central banks around the world.},

Additionally we study several ways to provide replay protection in the event of hardfork alongside a novel mechanism called migration inputs.

This kind of a decentralized prediction market can sustain betting on events whose outcome may remain unresolved for a long or even unlimited time period, and can facilitate trades among participants who are spread across diverse geographical locations, may wish to remain anonymous and/or avoid burdensome identification procedures, and are distrustful of each other. We describe how a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin can be enhanced to accommodate a truly decentralized prediction market, by employing an innovative variant of the Colored Coins concept. We examine the game-theoretic properties of our design, and offer extensions that enable other financial instruments as well as real-time exchange.},

@inproceedings{ECH12,
	abstract = {We propose and study the notion of concurrent ballot authorization for coercion-resistant, end-to-end verifi- able (E2E) internet voting. A central part of providing coercion resistance is the ability for an election authority to filter out fake ballots from legitimate ones in a way that is both private and universally verifiable. This ballot authorization process, however, can potentially come at a heavy computational cost. In previous proposals, the bulk of this computation cannot be performed until the last ballot has been cast. By contrast, concurrent ballot authorization allows ballots to be authorized as they are submitted, allowing the tally to be declared immediately after polls close. An efficient tally is especially impor- tant in the coercion-resistant internet voting setting, as it is particularly vulnerable to denial of service attacks caused by floods of fake ballots.
	<p></p>
	We present a proof-of-concept voting system, Cobra, the first coercion-resistant system to offer concurrent ballot authorization. Although Cobra offers the fastest tallying relative to the related work, it has a registration process that we consider to be too slow to be viable; one that is quadratic in the number of eligible voters. We present Cobra as a first-step toward what we hope will become a standard feature of coercion-resistant internet voting schemes: concurrent ballot authorization.},
