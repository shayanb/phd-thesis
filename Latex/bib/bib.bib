	abstract     = {The advent of decentralized trading markets introduces a number of new challenges for consensus protocols. In addition to the 'usual' attacks -- a subset of the validators trying to prevent agreement -- there is now the possibility of financial fraud, which can abuse properties not normally considered critical in consensus protocols. We investigate the issues of attackers manipulating or exploiting the order in which transactions are scheduled in the blockchain. More concretely, we look into order fairness, i.e., ways we can assure that the order of transactions relative to each other is fair. We show that one of the more intuitive definitions of fairness is impossible to achieve. We then present Wendy, a group of low overhead protocols that can implement different concepts of fairness. Wendy acts as an additional widget for an existing blockchain, and is largely agnostic to the underlying blockchain and its security assumptions, as long as they provide a known and always active set of validators. Furthermore, it is possible to implement fairness for some subsets of the transactions, and thus run several independent fair markets (as well as some unfair ones) on the same chain.},

A consensus protocol must satisfy two properties: consistency and liveness. These properties ensure that honest participating nodes agree on the same log and dictate when fresh transactions get added. They fail, however, to ensure against adversarial manipulation of the actual ordering of transactions in the log. Indeed, in leader-based protocols (almost all protocols used today), malicious leaders can directly choose the final transaction ordering.},

In addition to the 'usual' attacks -- a subset of the validators trying to prevent agreement -- there is now the possibility of financial fraud, which can abuse properties not normally considered critical in consensus protocols. We investigate the issues of attackers manipulating or exploiting the order in which transactions are scheduled in the blockchain. More concretely, we look into order fairness, i.e., ways we can assure that the order of transactions relative to each other is fair. We show that one of the more intuitive definitions of fairness is impossible to achieve. We then present Wendy, a group of low overhead protocols that can implement different concepts of fairness. Wendy acts as an additional widget for an existing blockchain, and is largely agnostic to the underlying blockchain and its security assumptions, as long as they provide a known and always active set of validators. Furthermore, it is possible to implement fairness for some subsets of the transactions, and thus run several independent fair markets (as well as some unfair ones) on the same chain.},

These properties ensure that honest participating nodes agree on the same log and dictate when fresh transactions get added. They fail, however, to ensure against adversarial manipulation of the actual ordering of transactions in the log. Indeed, in leader-based protocols (almost all protocols used today), malicious leaders can directly choose the final transaction ordering.},

Increased power consumption resulting from constant CPU and GPU usage from mining, inflated cooling and electricity costs, and wastage of resources that could otherwise benefit legitimate users are some of the factors that contribute to these incurred losses. Affected organizations currently have no way of detecting these covert, and at times illegal miners and often discover the abuse when attackers have already fled and the damage is done.},
